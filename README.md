## Assignment 1
> implement uart functions for an Atmega328p

## Assignment 2
> implement a delay loop for an Atmega328p to toggle the LED state

## Assignment 3
> implement code to print hexadecimal characters to uart and implement code to blink message through the LED

## Assignment 4
> implement Atmega328p timer to print temperature at regular interval

## Project 1
> implement code for Atmega328p to update LED and print date string every 500ms

## Project 2
> implement interrupt vector and cache system to write EEPROM config and vpd data while updating LED state

## Project 3
> implement code to use an API to change config settings, implement a temperature sensor fininte state machine, have the LED indicate the state of the machine, and implement a watchdog timer to reboot device if hung code occurs


## Final Project
> in progress
